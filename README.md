Based on my analysis, I found that games, social media apps, and messaging apps are the most commonly installed applications. My research indicates that Subway Surfers, Temple Run, and Candy Crush are among the most popular games. Similarly, Instagram, Facebook, and Google (which owns YouTube, another popular social media platform) are widely used social media apps. For communication, WhatsApp and Skype are popular choices, though Hangouts is less common these days.
